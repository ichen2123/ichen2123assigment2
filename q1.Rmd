```{r, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(gapminder)
# use ?gapminder get the desciption of the dataset `gapminder`
```

Consider the dataset `gapminder`.

##### (a) Modify the `continent` factor by classifying the Americas' countries into `South America` and `North America`
    Hint: the following countries are in South America.
    ```r
    c("Argentina", "Bolivia", "Brazil", "Chile", "Colombia", "Ecuador", "Paraguay", "Peru", "Trinidad and Tobago", "Uruguay", "Venezuela")
    ```
    You could use `case_when` function.



In the following questions, use the dataset modified in (a).



##### (b) How many countries are there in the dataset? How about for each continent?


##### (c) For each year, which country had the largest gdp per capital?


##### (d) For each continent, which country experienced the sharpest increment rate in life expectancy from 1997 to 2007?



##### (e) Focus on the data in year 2007, what are the correlation coefficients between life expectancy and gdp per capital for each continent?



##### (f) Visualize part (e) by plotting gdp per capital vs life expectancy.
